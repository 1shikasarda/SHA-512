# SHA-512
Secure Hash Algorithm

Aim: Implement following components of SHA-512.
o Length Field and Padding
o Majority Function
o Conditional Function

The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is a standard that was developed by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) and published as a Federal Information Processing
standard (FIP 180). It is sometimes referred to as Secure Hash Standard (SHS). The standard
is mostly based on MD5. The standard was revised in 1995 under FIP 180-1, which includes

SHA-1. It was revised later under FIP 180-2, which defines four new versions: SHA-224, SHA-
256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. SHA-512 is the version of SHA with a 512-bit message digest.

It has a more complex structure than the others, and its message digest is the longest. SHA-512
creates a digest of 512 bits from a multiple-block message. Each block is 1024 bits in length.
